Their organic traffic was stagnant, and they were heavily reliant on paid ads, which was eating into their profit margins.Step 1: Comprehensive SEO AuditI started with a comprehensive SEO audit. This included analyzing their website’s technical aspects, content quality, backlink profile, and current keyword rankings. I found several issues:Technical SEO: The website had slow load times, poor mobile optimization, and several broken links.Content: The site’s content was outdated, thin, and lacked optimization for target keywords.Backlinks: The site had very few quality backlinks and several spammy links from irrelevant sites.Step 2: Strategy DevelopmentBased on the audit, I developed a multi-phase SEO strategy:Technical Fixes: Improved site speed by compressing images, leveraging browser caching, and optimizing code. I also fixed broken links and ensured the website was fully responsive on all devices.Content Overhaul: Conducted thorough keyword research to identify high-potential keywords with moderate competition. We revamped existing content, optimizing it for these keywords, and created new, high-quality content around long-tail keywords that aligned with user intent.Link Building: Implemented a white-hat link-building campaign, focusing on earning backlinks from reputable industry websites, guest blogging, and reaching out to influencers for collaborations.Step 3: Implementation and MonitoringOnce the strategy was in place, we implemented changes gradually to monitor their impact. We used analytics tools to track keyword rankings, organic traffic, bounce rates, and conversion rates.Step 4: ResultsWithin three months, we began seeing significant improvements:Keyword Rankings: The site’s target keywords started climbing the search engine rankings. Several long-tail keywords reached the first page.Organic Traffic: Organic traffic increased by 60%, reducing the company’s reliance on paid ads.Conversion Rate: With better-targeted content and a faster, more user-friendly site, the conversion rate improved by 25%.Step 5: Continuous OptimizationSEO is never a one-time fix, so we continued to monitor and adjust the strategy. Regular content updates, ongoing link-building efforts, and keeping up with the latest SEO trends ensured sustained growth.",Search Engine Optimization Manager,Fiverr,http://fiverr.com,"38 Greene St, New York, , United States",Software Development ,,Public Company,https://www.linkedin.com/company/fiverr-com/,200K+ employees on LinkedIn ,$500M - $1B,"Search Engine Optimization, ISLAMABAD, ",,,,,,,,,,Sarhad University of Science and Information TechnologyDegree nameAssociate's degree Field of studyAccounting and FinanceDates attended or expected graduation2019 – 2021,Sarhad University of Science and Information TechnologyDegree nameAssociate's degree Field of studyAccounting and FinanceDates attended or expected graduation2019 – 2021,Sarhad University of Science and Information TechnologyDegree nameAssociate's degree Field of studyAccounting and FinanceDates attended or expected graduation2019 – 2021,Sarhad University of Science and Information TechnologyDegree nameAssociate's degree Field of studyAccounting and FinanceDates attended or expected graduation2019 – 2021,,,,,,"SEOmoz,Search Engine Technology,WordPress,Google Analytics,Search Analytics,English,Urdu,Professional Manner,C#,",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQH-IVOd06wa-A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1724928356358?e=1732147200&v=beta&t=V3nph0MJT5PMdG8xL53zzBBi4ukvtxTMTUDDXeBQKoQ
